@article{Puronas:2014aa,
	Abstract = {If the practical definition of the process of painting can be
              reduced to the liberating action of freely applying colour to a
              surface - a process that is not a manipulation of existing
              photographs (as in photomontage) - then motion picture sound is,
              more often than not, a hostage of pre-recorded sounds limited to
              layering and processing. Despite recent technological
              advancements, some of the most liberating sound design techniques
              to date are the early mechanical sound generation devices
              employed by Disney, as well as the worldising concept developed
              by Walter Murch. For many years, motion picture sound designers
              have employed de-contextualised post-sync sound (Foley sound
              effects) in order to provide a sense of elevated realism.
              Ironically, elevated realism is achieved by removing real
              recordings, (as reality is often found to be sonically
              underwhelming), and re-constructing a fabricated illusion of
              reality. The audience, however, accepts this illusion as more
              real than reality itself. Founded on the aesthetic principles of
              Photorealism, Hyperrealism questions the existence of objective
              reality by taking into account photographic artefacts and
              treating them as objects. In this article, the philosophy `as
              seen by the lens' is compared to `as heard by the microphone'.
              This article focuses on the issue of simulation of realism in
              motion picture sound. By highlighting some key concepts in the
              visual arts it stimulates thinking on the current state of sound
              design. It is a discussion on the power of blank canvas and
              paint, and on how these concepts relate to sound.},

	Abstract = {A new architecture for controlling mobile robots is described. Layers of control system are built to let the robot operate at increasing levels of competence. Layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.},

	Abstract = {Currently, the most popular method of visualizing music is music notation. Through music notation, an experienced musician can gain an impression of how a particular piece of music sounds simply by looking at the notes on paper. However, most listeners are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the complex nature of music notation. The goal of this project is to present an alternate method for visualizing music that makes use of color and 3D space. This paper describes one method of visualizing music in 3D space. The implementation of this method shows that music visualization is an effective technique, although it is certainly not the only possible method for accomplishing the task. Throughout the course of this project, several variations and alternative approaches were discussed. The final version of this project reflects the decisions that were made in order to present the best possible representation of music data.},

	Annote = {Close relationship between expression timing, global tempo and temporal structure
(example; sped-up swing doesn't work)

Beat position (score-time) and real-time (performance time) p.9

Distinction between rhythmic durations and expressive timing variations (Clarke 1999)

'Tempo functions are primarily used in music psychology research. They form the output of several generative models of expressive timing (e.g., Clynes 1995; Todd 1992; Sundberg 1988). Most of this research is concerned with keyboard music from the Baroque and Ro- mantic periods, where indeed tempo rubato (ex- pressive tempo fluctuations) serves an important expressive function. In some more recent studies, time-shift (or event-shift) patterns (i.e., timing measured as deviations from a regular pulse) are analyzed, for example, in studies of timing in jazz ballads (Ashley 1996) or in Cuban percussion mu- sic (Bilmes 1993). In computer music, time- maps---also referred to as time-deformation s (Anderson and Kuivila 1990) or time-warps (Dannenberg 1997)---are primarily used. They ex- press performance-time directly as a function of score-time, and can, in principle, describe both time-shift and tempo-change.' p.51

Tempo changes and performance characteristics (i.e. pushing or pulling) are different things.},

@article{Collins:2005aa,
	Abstract = {A three-year single case study of a composer was undertaken in order to track the compositional process in real time. A combination of data collection techniques was used to attempt to map cognitive processes: digital MIDI save-as files, analogue audio files, semi-structured interviews, immediately retrospective verbal accounts and verification sessions between composer and researcher. Findings indicated a chunking of processes and strategies at micro and macro levels. A hypothetical model is presented which points to a generative process of problem proliferation and successive solution implementation, occurring not only in a linear manner but also recursively. Moments of creative insight were observed which related to Gestalt theory problem restructuring; some were seen to overlap in real time with others, indicating an element of parallelism in creative thinking. A synthesis of differing creative process theories is suggested to explain the compositional process observed in the study.},

NSA, Prism etc. causing some concern regarding big data and its use by governments; how will Google respond?

Might be some space in using Google as engineering focus and Apple as design focus. Digital native design in iOS7 and what that means for interaction with devices. How does iOS make use of conceptual blends? Manipulation of the device (gyroscopes etc.) using depth as additional plane.},

Mass media - "we would not want a projectionist to be 'creative' in showing a conventional film". Artistry and imagination would be "negative qualities", i.e. Ronald McDonald

	Abstract = {This study introduces a casual model which links measures of computer experience, computer-related attitudes, computer-related confidence, and perceived computer-based knowledge. The model is based on the concept of computer literacy, and on an attitude-behaviour theory which argues that beliefs lead to attitudes, and that attitudes are an important precursor to behavior. The causal model suggests that computer use has a positive effect on perceived computer self-confidence, as well as on computer-related attitudes. The model hypothesizes that computer attitudes and computer confidence have a positive mutual effect, and that both factors positively effect perceived computer knowledge. Questionnaires were administered to 309 students in Grades 7-12. The theoretical model was tested by structural equation analysis (LISREL) and, as expected, all causal effects, including the reciprocal one, were confirmed. The contribution and relevance of these findings to future educational research and to school practices are discussed.},

@article{Lamont:2003aa,
	Abstract = {This article examines the perceived and documented problems of school music, particularly at secondary level, through a study of young people's music in and out of school. Four issues are explored: teachers' approaches to music in school; pupils' levels of engagement in musical activities in and out of school; pupils' attitudes to music in and out of school; and pupils' aspirations in music. A Pupils' Music Questionnaire was administered to 1,479 pupils in Years 4, 6, 7 and 9 (aged 8--14 years) from 21 schools in England; Teacher Interviews were conducted with 42 head teachers and teachers responsible for music in all these schools; and follow-up Music Focus Groups were conducted with 134 pupils from the original sample. In contrast to earlier research, both teachers and pupils across the sample demonstrated very positive attitudes towards music, whilst also acknowledging constraints on good practice. Music listening formed an important part of pupils' lives, but music making was more prominent than suggested by previous research. Commitment to musical activity seemed more robust out of school than in school, and it is suggested that involvement in musical activity may be transitory for some children and adolescents.},

Despite the potential, however, the field remains relatively unexplored. This paper therefore proposes a framework for further research and development in the field of computer-aided learning for students with autism. The framework is based around the core deficiencies of autism, namely a social impairment, a communication impairment, rigidity and inflexibility in thinking and a theory of mind deficit. Proposals for computer-aided learning systems for each of these areas are put forward, and our current development work outlined.},

Playing Video Games: Motives, Responses, and Consequences integrates communication, psychology, and technology to examine the psychological and mediated aspects of playing video games. It is the first volume to delve deeply into these aspects of computer game play. It fits squarely into the media psychology arm of entertainment studies, the next big wave in media studies. The book targets one of the most popular and pervasive media in modern times, and it will serve to define the area of study and provide a theoretical spine for future research.

@book{Cooper:2004aa,
	Annote = {## The Inmates are Running the Asylum by Alan Cooper

Takes a business case approach; why is a lot of IxD done badly and by the wrong people? Could be linked to the Google engineer-led approach vs. the Apple design-led approach. Must read.

An opinionated polemic. The initial chapters are written to establish software design as ripe for improvement, but the main arguments are common-sensical and fairly obvious from a 2013 perspective. The book has been influential and therefore much of modern design will flow from these principles. Establishes IxD as important, and stresses that software should not be designed by engineers.

Differentiates between 'interaction design' (user facing) and 'program design' (everything else).

Behavioral design; how software should act and communicate

Conceptual design; what is valuable for the users in the first place

Users should not feel stupid p25
Ejector-seat levers should not be presented alongside other controls

It isn't that the bear dances well; the amazing thing is that the bear can dance at all.

Apologists; explain cognitive friction away and pretend that all is well with software design p30. Power users are in this camp. 'Look, the bear can dance!'
Survivors; p.31. They know something is wrong and that computers are hard, but they don't know why. 'If all I can have is a dancing bear I'll have to take it'.

Computer-literate means the user has bowed to the crazy design problems of the software. Power users are apologists.

Plan to throw at least one prototype away; Frederick Brooks. You will anyway; might as well plan to do so.

Larry Keeley; three primary qualities in technology business.

1. Capability; what are we capable of? Engineers need to know what they can do.
2. Viabilty; contribution of business people. What can we sell?
3. Desirability; designer contribution. What do people want?

(my comment; stress on IxD goes directly against the Google engineer-led philosophy. It explains Apple's success but not the throw-it-at-the-wall Google mindset.)

Computers vs. humans p.87. The 'inside' needs to be written with sensitivity to computers, but the 'outside' needs to be written with social expertise and sensitivity to the needs of humans.

Fast > slow
Error-free > error-prone
Deterministic > Irrational
Apathetic > Emotional
Literal > Inferential
Sequential > Random
Predictable > Unpredictable
Amoral > Ethical
Stupid > Intelligent

(comment; my basic plan is to provide the software with humanising qualities)

Homo Logicus (programmers) vs. Homo Sapiens p.93. Seems quite damning of programmers. Desire control, trade simplicity for control. Logicus have desire to understand; Sapienes have desire to succeed. For Logicus, 'failure is the price to pay for understanding' p.97

Programmers create interaction which closely resembles the way the computer works, rather than mirroring the end user's goals. This is an *implementation model*.

Scarcity thinking p.119. Bill Moggeridge 'be kind to chips and cruel to users'. Being unnecessarily protective of the CPU.

Personas, as outlined in About Face 3.

Design with 'pretend it's magic'; a computer with no constraints. p.185

Design > Program > Bug Test/User test > Tweak p.205},

@article{Davidson:1996aa,
	Abstract = {Investigated the role of parents in the development of musical ability. Interviews were conducted with 257 children (aged 8--18 yrs) and their parents. All of the children had studied a musical instrument but differed in the extent of their mastery. It was discovered that the most successful children had parents who were the most highly involved in lessons and practice in the earliest stages of learning. These successful music learners often had parents who were involved with music themselves. Parental involvement in music typically took the form of listening to music rather than performing it, and tended to increase over the child's learning period. The children who failed to continue with lessons had parents who were, on average, less interested in music and who did not change their own degree of involvement with music over their child's learning period. Overall, the most musically able children had the highest levels of parental support. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2010 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	Annote = {Forward by Gillian Crampton Smith

David Liddle defines three stages of technology use (p. xii);

1. Enthusiast stage; it doesn't matter if the technology is easy or hard to use because it is exciting.
2. Professional stage; the users are often not those buying it. Difficulty is not of prime importance; price, performance specs, support etc. can be more important to the purchasers. Some users have a vested interest in difficulty; the harder it is to use, the more valuable their skills.
3. Consumer stage; people are less interested in the technology than in what it can do for them.

Design imperatives (pp. xiii-xiv);

1. Usability
2. Utility
3. Satisfaction
4. Communicative qualities
5. Sociability

Good interaction design (pp. xv-xvi);

1. Clear mental model (e.g. Apple's Hypercard)
2. Reassuring feedback (tactile keyboard, clicking)
3. Navigability
4. Consistency
5. Intuitive interaction

Languages of interaction design (pp.xvii-xviii);

* 1D; words and poetry. Menus and dialogue box text
* 2D; painting, typography, diagrams, icons. Focus, tone, meaning, communication.
* 3D; physical, sculptural forms. *Product semantics* explores how people understand what the different elements of a product represent. Handles, orientation (bigger base). Can also be used playfully, unexpectedly.
* 4D; sound, film, animation. Bill Gaver's SonicFinder made different noises for full or empty files and folders.

Other areas of investigation include young people's experiences and performances and preferences in using such games. Finally some recommendations are made concerning the planning and design of the future "edugames"},

Kurtag) are compared: an analysis performed by seven professional music analysts using the musical score, and a perceptual analysis carried out by two groups of subjects (18 musicians and 25 non-musicians) while listening in real time. Three possible macroforms proposed by the analysts were compared with those perceived by the listeners. The results show that the macroforms hypothesized by the analysts represented the basic framework for those perceived by the listeners; moreover, the musical competence possessed by the musicians who took part in the listening exercise does not, on the whole, appear to have affected the perception of the macroform of a post-tonal piece of music.},

	Annote = {p4 'The conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order' Papenek's definition of design

p7 People have to think like computers

p6 A diagram showing the goal-directed software development process, and how the introduction of GUIs added to the requirements of the development process

p8 Why are some products bad?
Ignorance about users
Conflicting interests; the programmer will find it hard to think of the user first
The lack of a process

p13 Addressing the goals (Rudolph, 1998) and motivations of users; goal-directed design. How people actually use products.

p18 Design should not be separate from the implementation model; should identify user requirements and define a plan for the behaviour and appearance of products. Design provides true product definition. Designers need to be involved in market research.

Crampton-Smith and Tabor; five component activities of interaction design
Understanding > Abstracting > Structuring > Representing > Detailing

Goal-directed design process overview p 20
Research > Modelling > Requirements > Framework > Refinement > Support

How a machine or programme actually works; the **implementation model** p28
The user has a **mental model** or conceptual model; a cognitive shorthand for explaining what it is doing. p28
The software has a **represented model**, where it shows the user a behavioural face which is not necessarily an accurate description of what is happening. p29.
'User interfaces should be based on user mental models rather than implementation models' p.31

Mechanical-Age representations; iron horses, horseless carriages etc. Can colour our thinking.
Some elements cannot or should not be translated verbatim i.e. reins for cars. p.35. Mechanical-Age artefacts should not be replicated without Information-Age enhancements. p.37

Most software users are *perpetual intermediates*; both beginners and experts gravitate towards intermediacy. p.42. 'Nobody wants to remain a beginner' p.43; they get better or give up. Good software design caters for the smaller groups but aims mostly at the intermediates. Some specialist software aims at experts (Pro Tools) and some for transitory use without time and repetition to get better (museum kiosks). Beginners need to advance to intermediate skill as fast as possible; help is needed.

Chapter 4 p.49 good primer on qualitative research

Personas (p.77) are models based on the behaviours and motivations of real people; *composite archetypes*. Based on observed behaviour from the research phase. This helps to choose the right individuals to design for. Avoids the problems of 'the elastic user' (whose skills change to fit the development team), self-referential design (designer using their own goals, skills, motivations and mental models) and concentrating too much on edge cases. p.79-80.

Norman's *Emotional Design* covers visceral, behavioural and reflective cognitive processing levels. Can be equated to *experience goals* (how the user wants to feel, i.e. remain focused), *end goals* (what a user wants to do, i.e. stay connected with friends) and *life goals* (who a user wants to be, i.e. succeed in my ambitions to...). p.92. User goals are user motivations p.94; successful products meet user goals first.

The development and use of scenarios Chapter 6 p.109.
Requirements Definition; what a product is and what it should do
Framework Definition; how a product behaves and how it is structured to meet user goals p.115

Requirements Definition process (p.116);

1. Creating problem and vision statements
2. Brainstorming
3. Identifying persona expectations
4. Constructing content scenarios
5. Identifying requirements

Defining the interaction framework (p.127). Not linear but iterative loops. 3 - 5 may be swapped around;

1. Define form factor, posture, and input methods
2. Define functional and data elements
3. Determine functional groups and hierarchy
4. Sketch the interaction framework
5. Construct key path scenarios
6. Check designs with validation scenarios

Design validation and usability testing p.142. Summative and formative evaluations, from *Usability Engineering* (Nielsen, 1993).

Design principles are guidelines for design of useful and desirable products, systems, and services, as well as guidelines for the successful and ethical practice of design. Design patterns are exemplary, generalisable solutions to specific classes of design problems. p.149

1. Design values describe imperatives for the effective and ethical practice of design. These principles inform and motivate lower-level principles.
2. Conceptual principles help define *what a product is* and how it fits into the board context of use required by its users.
3. Behavioural principles describe *how a product should behave*, in general, and in specific situations.
4. Interface-level principles describe effective strategies for the *visual communication of behaviour and information*. p.150

The design should minimise the work that the user needs to do;

1. Cognitive work;
2. Memory work;
3. Visual work;
4. Physical work. p.151
	
Design values p.151

* Ethical (considerate, helpful)
* Purposeful (useful, usable)
* Pragmatic (viable, feasible)
* Elegant (efficient, artful, affective)

Design patterns (p.156) are a means of capturing useful design solutions and generalising them to address similar problems. This effort to formalise design knowledge and record best practices can serve several vital purposes.

Types of interaction design patterns (p.158);

* Postural; help determine the overall product stance in relation to the user, i.e. 'transient' means the person only uses it for a short period.
* Structural; relate to the arrangement of information and functional elements on the screen. Views, panes, element groupings.
* Behavioural; relating to specific interactions with functional or data elements. Widget behaviours.

Posture p.162
Sovereign posture; full-screen, monopolise the user's attention. Users tend to become intermediate users. p.164
Transient posture; presents a single function with a constrained set of accompanying controls. p.169
Daemonic posture; no interaction, serve quietly and invisibly in the background. p.172

Embedded system; general design principles p. 182

* Don't think of your product as a computer
* Integrate your hardware and software design
* Let context drive the design
* Use modes judiciously, if at all
* Limit the scope
* Balance navigation with display density
* Customise for your platform

Flow and consistency, p.201
Flow; 'condition of deep, nearly meditative involvement' (from *Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams* by DeMarco and Lister; see also *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience* by Csikszentmigalyi.

Designing harmonious interactions p.203

* Follow users' mental modules
* Less is more
* Enable users to direct, don't force them to discuss
* Keep tools close at hand
* Provide modeless feedback
* Design for the probable; provide for the possible
* Provide comparisons
* Provide direct manipulation and graphical input
* Reflect object and application status
* Avoid unnecessary reporting
* Avoid blank slates
* Differentiate between command and configuration
* Provide choices
* Hide the ejector seat levers
* Optimise for responsiveness; accommodate latency

Eliminating excise; taking away additional tasks for the user p224. Hard to differentiate between design and navigation, for example.

Did not take notes from the latter chapters as they are very practical. Might need to come back to them when designing prototypes.},

We propose that a critical-and-constructive appraisal of existing and emerging digital media, communicative genres, literacy practices, and the communities made possible through them, can help to forge more responsive, and more ecologically responsible, language-learning opportunities for students who are expected to navigate increasingly mediated social and professional worlds.},

In addition to describing the nature of their students and the program in which the course is taught, many authors also share key issues with which they have grappled over the years while teaching their course; others discuss considerations that were relevant during the preparation of this particular syllabus or describe how it evolved in light of student input. The book is organized by areas within literacy education: reading; English/language arts; literature; emergent literacy; content-area literacy; literacy assessment and instruction; literacy and technology; and inquiries into literacy, theory, and classroom practice. It is accompanied by an interactive Web site: http://msit.gsu.edu/handbook. This online resource provides additional information about the authors' courses including complete syllabi, recommended readings, grading rubrics, and sample assignments. Readers are invited to respond and contribute their own syllabi and teaching experiences to the discourse generated by the volume.},

@inproceedings{Verenikina:2003aa,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this project is to examine the ways in which classical and modern theories of play may be applied to an analysis of the developmental value of computer software in the early childhood years. Modern and classical theories of play have identified many ways in which play may advance the cognitive, social and emotional development of children. However, in the last two decades there has been concern that play is being replaced by other activities such as computer games, ranging from commercial arcade games to different kinds of educational software. Whilst there has been an ongoing debate about the advantages and disadvantages of children's computer use, increased computer access for children in today's homes and childcare centres has become a reality. In view of this situation it is important that early childhood educators are able to judge the quality of computer games. When assessing the quality of particular items of computer software for young children, researchers refer to its developmental appropriateness. Within this frame of reference, software designers aim to present educational content in a playful way to make it more attractive and accessible to its young audience. However, there is a relative lack of focus on the value of computer use as play per se. If computer games are to become a significant part of children's lives we need to look at their developmental value from the same perspective that is taken when considering the significance of play in child development.},

@article{Jorgensen:2001aa,
	Abstract = {The question of when it is convenient to start with vocal and instrumental lessons is a much-debated issue. This article studies a group of conservatoire students and looks at the relationship between their current level of vocal and instrumental performance and the age when they started formal lessons. It concludes that, for the whole student population, those with highest grades started earlier. Looking at separate instruments, however, we see both a positive and a negative relationship between an early start and a high level of performance in the conservatoire. Additionally, there are large differences between students. The findings are discussed in the context of expertise theory.},

@article{Juslin:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Drawing on previous research, the author suggests that performance expression is best conceptualized as a multi-dimensional phenomenon consisting of five primary components: (a)
Generative rules that function to clarify the musical structure; (b) Emotional expression that serves to convey intended emotions to listeners; (c) Random variations that reflect human limitations with regard to internal time-keeper variance and motor delays; (d) Motion principles that prescribe that some aspects of the performance (e.g. timing) should be shaped in accordance with patterns of biological motion; and (e) Stylistic unexpectedness that involves local deviations from performance conventions. An analysis of performance expression in terms
of these five components -- collectively referred to as the {GERMS} model -- has important implications for research and teaching of music performance.},

@article{Butler:1990aa,
	Abstract = {It is paradoxical that although there is general agreemenrt that imlusici pitc1b perception is much more accurate when the listener is givetn a tonal {cOl1tt} for the stimulus, leading perceptual theories disagree in their definitiois o tonal context itself. Nearly all cognitive theories of so-called pitch istruct Li-., in music assume that relations among acoustical components of sound. or mathematical groups, or geometrical constructs, can serve as adequate bases on which rules of musical composition and comprehension of pitch relationl- ships may be formulated. These theories have an obvious intellectual iippecai but do not describe the temporal structure of pitch relations in actual music, and thus fail to account for significant differences in the compositiona treatment of pitch from one style period, or one culture, to another. I hc perceptual theory of event hierarchies, advanced most notably by Bharucha attempts to describe the perception of pitch relationships in musical timtc and thus is an important exception to the rule that perceptual theories oi musical pitch deal solely in timeless abstractions. The event-hierarchhx theory holds that as musical events (tones, chords) unfold in a specitic composition, they are interpreted hierarchically by the listener; this cxvent hierarchy activates in the listener a tonal hierarchy, a hierarchy of ccivt classes. The two hierarchies are thought to be perceptually co-generativec symbiotic partners in what Deutsch (1984) calls an "elaborate bootstrapping operation". No adequate description yet exists of this bootstrapping opera tion, in which relatively stable and unstable members of a totial hierarchx are said to generate a piece-specific event hierarchy as the event hicrarchx defines the tonal hierarchy. Beyond the critical chicken-egg character of such a theory, there is the likelihood that the theory is far more comuplex than the cognitive act it is supposed to describe. An inspection of represen- tative samples of Western tonal and post-tonal music shows that stvic- dependent differences exist in the time orders of intervals that occtur onlv rarely in the diatonic set. The paper includes the first report of the results of an experiment using temporal organising schemes extracted from actual tonal and post-tonal compositions. These results indicate that aural context conveyed by temporal collocation of rare intervals may be as influenti'il as pitch content is in eliciting a sense of tonal structure in the musical listener. and further that temporal organisation of rare intervals mav provide perceptual cues for metrical organisation in tonal music.},

@article{Tallal:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Children with language-learning impairments ({LLI)} form a heterogeneous population with the majority having both spoken and written language deficits as well as sensorimotor deficits, specifically those related to dynamic processing. Research has focused on whether or not sensorimotor deficits, specifically auditory spectrotemporal processing deficits, cause phonological deficit, leading to language and reading impairments. New trends aimed at resolving this question include prospective longitudinal studies of genetically at-risk infants, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, and studies aimed at evaluating the effects of auditory training (including musical training) on brain organization for language. Better understanding of the origins of developmental {LLI} will advance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in language development and lead to more effective educational and intervention strategies. This review is part of the {INMED/TINS} special issue Nature and Nurture in Brain Development and Neurological Disorders, based on presentations at the annual {INMED/TINS} symposium (http://inmednet.com/).},

within popular music discourse. It synthesises a range of views as to how authenticity is constructed,
and offers a tri-partite typology dependent on asking who, rather than what, is being authenticated.
It focuses on rock and folk genres, but also argues that the generic nature of the typology makes it
applicable to any other genre wherein listeners are concerned to ask whether a musical utterance can
be construed as sincere.},

Multilevel models applied to hierarchical data allow the groups that differ with regard to expected performance to be created at the child and preschool center levels. These multilevel analyses indicate powerful effects for the home learning environment and important effects of specific preschool centers at school entry.
