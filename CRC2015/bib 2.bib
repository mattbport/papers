                 on their more negative effects (e.g., addiction, increased
                 aggression). This study departs from the traditional clinical
                 and social learning explanations for these behavioral
                 phenomena and examines the effect of personality, in-game
                 reinforcement characteristics, gender, and skill on the
                 emotional state of the game-player. Results demonstrated that
                 in-game reinforcement characteristics and skill significantly
                 effect a number of affective measures (most notably excitement
                 and frustration). The implications of the impact of game-play
                 on affect are discussed with reference to the concepts of
                 ``addiction'' and ``aggression.''",

  author    = "Manaris, Bill and Brown, Andrew R",
  abstract  = "Teach Your Students How to Use Computing to Explore Powerful and
               Creative Ideas In the twenty-first century, computers have
               become indispensable in music making, distribution, performance,
               and consumption. Making Music with Computers: Creative
               Programming in Python introduces important concepts and skills
               necessary to generate music with computers. It interweaves
               computing pedagogy with musical concepts and creative
               activities, showing students how to integrate the creativity and
               design of the arts with the mathematical rigor and formality of
               computer science. The book provides an introduction to creative
               software development in the Python programming language. It uses
               innovative music-creation activities to illustrate introductory
               computer programming concepts, including data types, algorithms,
               operators, iteration, lists, functions, and classes. The authors
               also cover GUIs, event-driven programming, big data,
               sonification, MIDI programming, client--server programming,
               recursion, fractals, and complex system dynamics. Requiring
               minimal musical or programming experience, the text is designed
               for courses in introductory computer science and computing in
               the arts. It helps students learn computer programming in a
               creative context and understand how to build computer music
               applications. Also suitable for self-study, the book shows
               musicians and digital music enthusiasts how to write music
               software and create algorithmic music compositions. Web
               ResourceA supplementary website (http://jythonMusic.org)
               provides a music library and other software resources used in
               the text. The music library is an extension of the jMusic
               library and incorporates other cross-platform programming tools.

  abstract      = "In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The
                   flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music.
                   While much has been written about the origin and evolution
                   of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather
                   than scientific in nature. To rectify this we investigate
                   the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using Music
                   Information Retrieval (MIR) and text-mining tools we analyse
                   the musical properties of ~17,000 recordings that appeared
                   in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their
                   harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these
                   properties to produce an audio-based classification of
                   musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity
                   and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical
                   theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether
                   pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We
                   show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it
                   did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic
                   ``revolutions'' around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by
                   discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative
                   science of cultural change.",

  abstract  = "Although visual programming techniques have been used to lower
               the threshold of programming for end users, they are not
               sufficient for creating end user programming environments that
               are both easy to use and powerful. To achieve this, an
               environment must support the definition of programs that are not
               just static representations of behavior, but are instead dynamic
               collections of program objects which can be applied in a number
               of contexts rather than just a program editor. We describe an
               approach to end user programming called tactile programming
               which extends visual techniques with a unified program
               manipulation paradigm that makes programs easy to comprehend,
               compose and, most importantly, share over the World Wide Web.
               Tactile programming's inherent ability to support the social
               context in which programming takes place along with its ability
               to ease program comprehension and composition is what
               differentiates this approach from others. In the context of the
               Agentsheets programming substrate, we have created an instance

  abstract  = "The Sound Studies Reader blends recent work that
               self-consciously describes itself as ‘sound studies’ along with
               earlier and lesser-known scholarship on sound from across the
               humanities and social sciences. The Sound Studies Reader touches
               on key themes like noise and silence; architecture, acoustics
               and space; media and reproducibility; listening, voices and
               disability; culture, community, power and difference; and shifts
               in the form and meaning of sound across cultures, contexts and
               centuries. Writers reflect on crucial historical moments,
               difficult definitions, and competing accounts of the role of
               sound in culture and everyday life. Across the essays, readers
               will gain a sense of the range and history of key debates and
               discussions in sound studies. The collection begins with an
               introduction to welcome novice readers to the field and acquaint
               them the main issues in sound studies. Individual section
               introductions give readers further background on the essays and
               an extensive up to date bibliography for further reading in
               sound studies make this an original and accessible guide to the
               field. Contributors: Rick Altman, Jacques Attali, Roland

               by some theoretical limits on communication latency and what
               they mean for music making. Then a representative list of some
               of the projects that take advantage of the protocol is
               presented, describing each project in terms of the paradigm of
               musical interaction that it provides.",

  abstract = "The synthesis of individual virtual auditory space (VAS) is an
              important and challenging task in virtual reality. One of the key
              factors for individual VAS is to obtain a set of individual head
              related transfer functions (HRTFs). A customization method based
              on back-propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) is
              proposed to obtain an individual HRTF without complex
              measurement. The inputs of the neural network are the
              anthropometric parameters chosen by correlation analysis and the
              outputs are the characteristic parameters of HRTFs together with
              the interaural time difference (ITD). Objective simulation
              experiments and subjective sound localization experiments are
              implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
              Experiments show that the estimated non-individual HRTF has small
              mean square error, and has similar perception effect to the
              corresponding one obtained from the database. Furthermore, the
              localization accuracy of personalized HRTF is increased compared
              to the non-individual HRTF.",

              creativity for use with secondary school students. A Scientific
              Creativity Structure Model (SCSM) was constructed on the basis of
              an analysis of meanings and aspects of scientific creativity
              found in the literature. 50 science teachers in China took part
              in an initial evaluation of this model. On the basis of their
              analyses and comments, and drawing on the experience of the
              Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, a 7-item scale for measuring
              scientific creativity of secondary school students was developed
              and validated through analyses of item response data of 160
              secondary school students in England. Item analyses were
              conducted to check on item discrimination, internal consistency,
              agreement between scorers, construct-related validity, and face
              validity. Analysis showed adequate reliabilities and validities.
              As an example of how the test might be used, data from the pilot
              use of the test were used to investigate the relative scientific
              creativity of students of different age and ability level. The
              results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
              creativity of secondary school students increases with increase
              in age, and science ability is a necessary but not sufficient
              condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also

  abstract = "Flipped classroom approaches remove the traditional transmissive
              lecture and replace it with active in-class tasks and
              pre-/post-class work. Despite the popularity of these approaches
              in the media, Google search, and casual hallway chats, there is
              very little evidence of effectiveness or consistency in
              understanding what a flipped classroom actually is. Although the
              flipped terminology is new, some of the approaches being labelled
              ‘flipped’ are actually much older. In this paper, we provide a
              catch-all definition for the flipped classroom, and attempt to
              retrofit it with a pedagogical rationale, which we articulate
              through six testable propositions. These propositions provide a
              potential agenda for research about flipped approaches and form
              the structure of our investigation. We construct a theoretical
              argument that flipped approaches might improve student motivation
              and help manage cognitive load. We conclude with a call for more

               statements nor for deriving interesting consequences. As a first

                  compare how simply you can express a concept in them? One
                  proxy for this is how many lines of code change in each
                  commit. This would provide a view into how expressive each
                  language enables you to be in the same amount of space.
                  Because the number of bugs in code is proportional to the
                  number of source lines, not the number of ideas expressed, a
                  more expressive language is always worth considering for that

               nonhuman organisms, which presumably have built-in genetic
               programs instructing them to live as long as their physical
               machinery is able to function. But our species has a choice:
               With the development of consciousness, we have the ability to
               second-guess and occasionally override the instructions coded in
               our chromosomes. This evolutionary development has added a great
               deal of flexibility to the human repertoire of behaviors. But
               the freedom gained has its downside---too many possibilities can
               have a paralyzing effect on action (Schwartz 2000). Among the
               options we are able to entertain is that of ending our lives;
               thus, as the existential philosophers remarked, the question of
               why one should not commit suicide is fundamental to the

  abstract  = "In rich pervasive environments, there will be numerous
               opportunities for end users to dynamically create services of
               interest by causing two or more devices or resources to
               interoperate together, often under changing circumstances. In
               general, users find this kind of process hard to manage.
               Existing programming architectures make the situation difficult
               to address in a principled, scaleable way. Users find it hard to
               tackle such problems via devices with small, resource-poor user
               interfaces. It is proposed that a good theoretical basis for
               addressing an essential aspect of all of these problems is the
               theory of Direct Combination. When the Direct Combination
               framework, based on the theory, is applied to spontaneous
               interactions, the user interface can be made relatively simple,
               and the amount of search required by the user to specify desired
               actions can be greatly reduced. We present Direct Combination
               (DC) and the new interaction techniques it gives rise to for
               pervasive environments. We consider two different support
               architectures. We argue that one of these, the role-based
               architecture, has particularly good properties for modelling
               rapidly changing pervasive environments, and for highly
               distributed implementations. We demonstrate how the concept of
               viewpoints can be used to focus, filter and afford operations,
               and how this can be well supported by the role-based
               architecture.",

              reduced to the liberating action of freely applying colour to a
              surface -- a process that is not a manipulation of existing
              photographs (as in photomontage) -- then motion picture sound is,
              more often than not, a hostage of pre-recorded sounds limited to
              layering and processing. Despite recent technological
              advancements, some of the most liberating sound design techniques
              to date are the early mechanical sound generation devices
              employed by Disney, as well as the worldising concept developed
              by Walter Murch. For many years, motion picture sound designers
              have employed de-contextualised post-sync sound (Foley sound
              effects) in order to provide a sense of elevated realism.
              Ironically, elevated realism is achieved by removing real
              recordings, (as reality is often found to be sonically
              underwhelming), and re-constructing a fabricated illusion of
              reality. The audience, however, accepts this illusion as more
              real than reality itself. Founded on the aesthetic principles of
              Photorealism, Hyperrealism questions the existence of objective
              reality by taking into account photographic artefacts and
              treating them as objects. In this article, the philosophy ‘as
              seen by the lens’ is compared to ‘as heard by the microphone’.
              This article focuses on the issue of simulation of realism in
              motion picture sound. By highlighting some key concepts in the
              visual arts it stimulates thinking on the current state of sound
              design. It is a discussion on the power of blank canvas and
              paint, and on how these concepts relate to sound.",

  author   = "Butler, David",
  abstract = "It is paradoxical that although there is general agreemenrt that
              imlusici pitc1b perception is much more accurate when the
              listener is givetn a tonal cOl1tt for the stimulus, leading
              perceptual theories disagree in their definitiois o tonal context
              itself. Nearly all cognitive theories of so-called pitch istruct
              Li-., in music assume that relations among acoustical components
              of sound. or mathematical groups, or geometrical constructs, can
              serve as adequate bases on which rules of musical composition and
              comprehension of pitch relationl- ships may be formulated. These
              theories have an obvious intellectual iippecai but do not
              describe the temporal structure of pitch relations in actual
              music, and thus fail to account for significant differences in
              the compositiona treatment of pitch from one style period, or one
              culture, to another. I hc perceptual theory of event hierarchies,
              advanced most notably by Bharucha attempts to describe the
              perception of pitch relationships in musical timtc and thus is an
              important exception to the rule that perceptual theories oi
              musical pitch deal solely in timeless abstractions. The
              event-hierarchhx theory holds that as musical events (tones,
              chords) unfold in a specitic composition, they are interpreted
              hierarchically by the listener; this cxvent hierarchy activates
              in the listener a tonal hierarchy, a hierarchy of ccivt classes.
              The two hierarchies are thought to be perceptually co-generativec
              symbiotic partners in what Deutsch (1984) calls an ``elaborate
              bootstrapping operation''. No adequate description yet exists of
              this bootstrapping opera tion, in which relatively stable and
              unstable members of a totial hierarchx are said to generate a
              piece-specific event hierarchy as the event hicrarchx defines the
              tonal hierarchy. Beyond the critical chicken-egg character of
              such a theory, there is the likelihood that the theory is far
              more comuplex than the cognitive act it is supposed to describe.
              An inspection of represen- tative samples of Western tonal and
              post-tonal music shows that stvic- dependent differences exist in
              the time orders of intervals that occtur onlv rarely in the
              diatonic set. The paper includes the first report of the results
              of an experiment using temporal organising schemes extracted from
              actual tonal and post-tonal compositions. These results indicate
              that aural context conveyed by temporal collocation of rare
              intervals may be as influenti'il as pitch content is in eliciting
              a sense of tonal structure in the musical listener. and further
              that temporal organisation of rare intervals mav provide
              perceptual cues for metrical organisation in tonal music.",

  abstract = "Drawing on previous research, the author suggests that
              performance expression is best conceptualized as a
              multi-dimensional phenomenon consisting of five primary
              components: (a) Generative rules that function to clarify the
              musical structure; (b) Emotional expression that serves to convey
              intended emotions to listeners; (c) Random variations that
              reflect human limitations with regard to internal time-keeper
              variance and motor delays; (d) Motion principles that prescribe
              that some aspects of the performance (e.g. timing) should be
              shaped in accordance with patterns of biological motion; and (e)
              Stylistic unexpectedness that involves local deviations from
              performance conventions. An analysis of performance expression in
              terms of these five components -- collectively referred to as the
              GERMS model -- has important implications for research and
              teaching of music performance.",

  abstract  = "The purpose of this project is to examine the ways in which
               classical and modern theories of play may be applied to an
               analysis of the developmental value of computer software in the
               early childhood years. Modern and classical theories of play
               have identified many ways in which play may advance the
               cognitive, social and emotional development of children.
               However, in the last two decades there has been concern that
               play is being replaced by other activities such as computer
               games, ranging from commercial arcade games to different kinds
               of educational software. Whilst there has been an ongoing debate
               about the advantages and disadvantages of children's computer
               use, increased computer access for children in today's homes and
               childcare centres has become a reality. In view of this
               situation it is important that early childhood educators are
               able to judge the quality of computer games. When assessing the
               quality of particular items of computer software for young
               children, researchers refer to its developmental
               appropriateness. Within this frame of reference, software
               designers aim to present educational content in a playful way to
               make it more attractive and accessible to its young audience.
               However, there is a relative lack of focus on the value of
               computer use as play per se. If computer games are to become a
               significant part of children's lives we need to look at their
               developmental value from the same perspective that is taken when
               considering the significance of play in child development.",

               and thinking of a wide range of well-known literacy researchers,
               and the lessons they have learned from their own teaching lives.
               The contributors teach in a variety of universities, programs,
               and settings. Each shares an approach he or she has used in a
               course, and introduces the syllabus for this course through
               personal reflections that give the reader a sense of the
               theories, prior experiences, and influential authors that have
               shaped their own thoughts and approaches. In addition to
               describing the nature of their students and the program in which
               the course is taught, many authors also share key issues with
               which they have grappled over the years while teaching their
               course; others discuss considerations that were relevant during
               the preparation of this particular syllabus or describe how it
               evolved in light of student input. The book is organized by
               areas within literacy education: reading; English/language arts;
               literature; emergent literacy; content-area literacy; literacy
               assessment and instruction; literacy and technology; and
               inquiries into literacy, theory, and classroom practice. It is
               accompanied by an interactive Web site:
               http://msit.gsu.edu/handbook. This online resource provides
               additional information about the authors' courses including
               complete syllabi, recommended readings, grading rubrics, and
               sample assignments. Readers are invited to respond and

              Three possible macroforms proposed by the analysts were compared

              ability. Interviews were conducted with 257 children (aged 8--18
              yrs) and their parents. All of the children had studied a musical
              instrument but differed in the extent of their mastery. It was
              discovered that the most successful children had parents who were
              the most highly involved in lessons and practice in the earliest
              stages of learning. These successful music learners often had
              parents who were involved with music themselves. Parental
              involvement in music typically took the form of listening to
              music rather than performing it, and tended to increase over the
              child's learning period. The children who failed to continue with
              lessons had parents who were, on average, less interested in
              music and who did not change their own degree of involvement with
              music over their child's learning period. Overall, the most
              musically able children had the highest levels of parental
              support. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights

               and fairly obvious from a 2013 perspective. The book has been
               influential and therefore much of modern design will flow from
               these principles. Establishes IxD as important, and stresses

               that cross gender, culture, and age is on a dramatic upward

               technology to examine the psychological and mediated aspects of
               playing video games. It is the first volume to delve deeply into

               pervasive media in modern times, and it will serve to define the
               area of study and provide a theoretical spine for future

              NIELSEN on January 1, 1995 Topics: Heuristic Evaluation Human
              Computer Interaction Standards Web Usability Summary: Jakob
              Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. They are
              called ``heuristics'' because they are broad rules of thumb and
              not specific usability guidelines. Visibility of system status
              The system should always keep users informed about what is going
              on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. Match
              between system and the real world The system should speak the
              users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the
              user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world
              conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical
              order. User control and freedom Users often choose system
              functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked ``emergency
              exit'' to leave the unwanted state without having to go through
              an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo. Consistency and
              standards Users should not have to wonder whether different
              words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow
              platform conventions. Error prevention Even better than good
              error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from
              occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone
              conditions or check for them and present users with a
              confirmation option before they commit to the action. Recognition
              rather than recall Minimize the user's memory load by making
              objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have
              to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.
              Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily
              retrievable whenever appropriate. (Read full article on
              recognition vs. recall in UX.) Flexibility and efficiency of use
              Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up
              the interaction for the expert user such that the system can
              cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to
              tailor frequent actions. Aesthetic and minimalist design
              Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or
              rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue
              competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes
              their relative visibility. Help users recognize, diagnose, and
              recover from errors Error messages should be expressed in plain
              language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and
              constructively suggest a solution. Help and documentation Even
              though it is better if the system can be used without
              documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and
              documentation. Any such information should be easy to search,
              focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried
              out, and not be too large. I originally developed the heuristics
              for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in
              1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990]. I since
              refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249
              usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics
              with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of
              heuristics [Nielsen 1994b]. See Also: Bruce ``Tog'' Tognazzini's
              list of basic principles for interface design. The list is
              slightly too long for heuristic evaluation but serves as a useful
              checklist. Examples of the 10 heuristics in Web applications. The

              accepted by students with autism and is of great potential
              benefit to them. Despite the potential, however, the field
              remains relatively unexplored. This paper therefore proposes a
              framework for further research and development in the field of
              computer-aided learning for students with autism. The framework
              is based around the core deficiencies of autism, namely a social
              impairment, a communication impairment, rigidity and
              inflexibility in thinking and a theory of mind deficit. Proposals
              for computer-aided learning systems for each of these areas are
              put forward, and our current development work outlined.",

  abstract = "This article examines the perceived and documented problems of
              school music, particularly at secondary level, through a study of
              young people's music in and out of school. Four issues are
              explored: teachers' approaches to music in school; pupils' levels
              of engagement in musical activities in and out of school; pupils'
              attitudes to music in and out of school; and pupils' aspirations
              in music. A Pupils' Music Questionnaire was administered to 1,479
              pupils in Years 4, 6, 7 and 9 (aged 8--14 years) from 21 schools
              in England; Teacher Interviews were conducted with 42 head
              teachers and teachers responsible for music in all these schools;
              and follow-up Music Focus Groups were conducted with 134 pupils
              from the original sample. In contrast to earlier research, both
              teachers and pupils across the sample demonstrated very positive
              attitudes towards music, whilst also acknowledging constraints on
              good practice. Music listening formed an important part of
              pupils' lives, but music making was more prominent than suggested
              by previous research. Commitment to musical activity seemed more
              robust out of school than in school, and it is suggested that
              involvement in musical activity may be transitory for some
              children and adolescents.",

              computer experience, computer-related attitudes, computer-related
              confidence, and perceived computer-based knowledge. The model is
              based on the concept of computer literacy, and on an
              attitude-behaviour theory which argues that beliefs lead to
              attitudes, and that attitudes are an important precursor to
              behavior. The causal model suggests that computer use has a
              positive effect on perceived computer self-confidence, as well as
              on computer-related attitudes. The model hypothesizes that
              computer attitudes and computer confidence have a positive mutual
              effect, and that both factors positively effect perceived
              computer knowledge. Questionnaires were administered to 309
              students in Grades 7-12. The theoretical model was tested by
              structural equation analysis (LISREL) and, as expected, all
              causal effects, including the reciprocal one, were confirmed. The
              contribution and relevance of these findings to future
              educational research and to school practices are discussed.",

              order to track the compositional process in real time. A
              combination of data collection techniques was used to attempt to
              map cognitive processes: digital MIDI save-as files, analogue
              audio files, semi-structured interviews, immediately
              retrospective verbal accounts and verification sessions between
              composer and researcher. Findings indicated a chunking of
              processes and strategies at micro and macro levels. A
              hypothetical model is presented which points to a generative
              process of problem proliferation and successive solution
              implementation, occurring not only in a linear manner but also
              recursively. Moments of creative insight were observed which
              related to Gestalt theory problem restructuring; some were seen
              to overlap in real time with others, indicating an element of
              parallelism in creative thinking. A synthesis of differing
              creative process theories is suggested to explain the
              compositional process observed in the study.",

              of several generative models of expressive timing (e.g., Clynes
              1995; Todd 1992; Sundberg 1988). Most of this research is
              concerned with keyboard music from the Baroque and Ro- mantic
              periods, where indeed tempo rubato (ex- pressive tempo
              fluctuations) serves an important expressive function. In some
              more recent studies, time-shift (or event-shift) patterns (i.e.,
              timing measured as deviations from a regular pulse) are analyzed,
              for example, in studies of timing in jazz ballads (Ashley 1996)
              or in Cuban percussion mu- sic (Bilmes 1993). In computer music,
              time- maps---also referred to as time-deformation s (Anderson and
              Kuivila 1990) or time-warps (Dannenberg 1997)---are primarily
              used. They ex- press performance-time directly as a function of

  abstract  = "Currently, the most popular method of visualizing music is music
               notation. Through music notation, an experienced musician can
               gain an impression of how a particular piece of music sounds
               simply by looking at the notes on paper. However, most listeners
               are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the complex nature of music
               notation. The goal of this project is to present an alternate
               method for visualizing music that makes use of color and 3D
               space. This paper describes one method of visualizing music in
               3D space. The implementation of this method shows that music
               visualization is an effective technique, although it is
               certainly not the only possible method for accomplishing the
               task. Throughout the course of this project, several variations
               and alternative approaches were discussed. The final version of
               this project reflects the decisions that were made in order to
               present the best possible representation of music data.",

              Layers of control system are built to let the robot operate at
              increasing levels of competence. Layers are made up of
              asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth
              channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple
              computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles
              of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower
              levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The
              result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system
              has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around
              unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms.
              Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the
